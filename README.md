## Extensions
You have suggested some really useful improvements. 

###Pull in an image for the country from Pixabay API when the entered location brings up no results
That was quite fun. However I could not find any real locations which could be found in geonames but not in pixabay. But in Tests everything worked fine.

###Incorporate icons into forecast.
The weatherbit api seemed to FORCE you to use their icons by giving the icon-id in the API-response. That was a low hanging fruit.

###Integrate the REST Countries API to pull in data for the country being visited.
There's a TODO yet
