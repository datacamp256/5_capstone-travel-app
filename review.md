Sadly at my company we are not allowed to get acces to the Udacity Knowledge Platform. My real name is also not "Data Camp256" and "Brian" is just my nickname. It has to be something about data protection or protection of poaching employees...

## Code Reviews
Thanks for your valuable input. Finally, I took part in the nanodegree course to learn new things (although I really want this project to be well done by October 14th).

I have implemented the suggestions. I have two or three comments on this.

### src/client/js/fetcher.js 2
#### Using axios instead of fetch
In our team we're using wretcher, which is - as my colleague says - quite similar. I wanted to stay as close at the course as possible.

For timing reasons (project has to be complete until Oct 14th) I will not add Axios in this submission but I give it a try now - in case there will be new findings in the second review.

### src/client/views/index.html 
The script tag. THAT was the missing link!!! Thank you!!

Best regards,
brian
